- Watir interacts with a browser the same way people do by clicking links, filling out forms, validating text, resizing browser window and it also measure the performance of pages.

### How to create environment to use watir?

- Before going further lets see how to setup a testing environment using Watir.

Q. Anybody knows what is webdriver and why we need this?
```
- WebDriver communicates with the browser using an specific protocol called the WebDriver JSON Wire Protocol.

There are multiple browser vendors like

* Google

and others.

- So we need to install drivers for different browsers.
- Google chrome supports chromedriver
- Mozilla supports Geckodriver
- Microsoft edge supports microsoft web-driver
- Safari supports safari driver if you are on MAC there is no need to install driver for safari it is preinstalled.
