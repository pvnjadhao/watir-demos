### What is Watir?

A Watir stands for **Web Application Testing In Ruby**. It is also as Watir-Webdriver.

Its an open source Ruby library for writing automated tests.

Watir interacts with a browser the same way people do by clicking links, filling out forms, validating text, resizing browser window and it also measure the performance of pages.

The latest version of Watir is 6.16. The watir tests developed and run against the brower.
